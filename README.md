# Wondr'y Ideas Platform

## Overview

The Wondr'y Ideas Platform is a virtual collaboration space designed to facilitate brainstorming, idea sharing, and evaluation among users. It aims to integrate various design thinking principles, reducing reliance on third-party applications, and providing an all-in-one solution for the innovation process. This project seeks to create a customizable platform for Wondr'y, moving away from the current Wazoku platform.

## Project Goals

- **Virtual Brainstorming**: Create a seamless virtual brainstorming environment where users can collaboratively contribute and edit ideas in real-time.
- **File Sharing**: Implement file sharing capabilities within the platform to allow users to exchange important documents and resources.
- **Idea Evaluation**: Incorporate a system to evaluate and score ideas based on customizable criteria.
- **Design Thinking Integration**: Use design thinking principles to enhance the user experience and encourage innovative ideas.
- **Reduced Third-Party Dependency**: Build features in-house to avoid reliance on external applications and tools.

## Frameworks and Technologies

- **Front-end**: Likely to use **React** for a dynamic, user-friendly interface.
- **Back-end**: **Node.js** or **Django** can be used to handle the server-side logic.
- **Database**: Initially leveraging free servers such as **MongoDB Atlas** or **Firebase** for database management, with the potential to migrate to paid cloud services (AWS or Google Cloud) based on client needs.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Exploring integration with tools like the **Miro API** for enhanced collaboration features.
- **File Sharing**: Using services such as **Google Drive API** or **Dropbox API** for file management within the platform.
